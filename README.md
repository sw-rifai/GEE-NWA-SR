GEE-NWA-SR
==========
Google Earth Engine - Northwest Amazon - Surface Reflectance 

These are a series of Ipython notebooks for use with Google Earth Engine. To initialize them you must have the permissions for the GEE API. 

Analysis specifics: 
All endmembers are image derived from LEDAPS processed surface reflectance products of Landsat 5. 
-Caution - the endmembers were taken from images between 2009 to 2011. It is likely that alternative endmembers would need to be collected for analysis done on images acquired during earlier years due to the sensor degradation. Alternatively, it may be possible to apply a linear transform but I have not tried this as of yet.
